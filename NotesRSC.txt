========

Am now planning to deploy the slideshow django app to Heroku
(the PythonAnywhere pa_autoconfig... script is not working, and have spent a bit of time messing with it).

Here is what I have read so far regarding Heroku deployment:
1. Django is supported.
   So all the work I have done to this point will get used.
2. Will need to change DB to Postgres (but see note below - maybe no need to install locally).
   This is what Heroku uses. DjangoGirls has a tutorial to install this:
      https://tutorial-extensions.djangogirls.org/en/optional_postgresql_installation/
   They also have a tutorial that continues the blog tutorial for Heroku:  
      https://tutorial-extensions.djangogirls.org/en/heroku/
3. I will use these in conjunction with the official Heroku tutorial:
      https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#deploy-the-app
4. The Heroku tutorial is for Python 3.7 (which would be my first choice).

DATABASE:
=========
According to the DjangoGirls tutorial, I can use sqlite for local storage and postgres for deploy.
This is handled by having a mysite/settings.py (postgres) and mysite/local_settings.py (sqlite) files.
We can then run the migration from sqlite to postgres.
